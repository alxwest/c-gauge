This is a very rough draft so is subject to change. Anything labelled draft should be disregarded.

This page will serve as a TODO page. Until at such time it moves to it's own page.

## Introduction

It's been 40 years and humanity is no closer to finding the root of physics and in it's stead we have the minutiae of maths. Over the last century we have progressed in terms of technology but in the pursuit of understanding we currently have a fractured, siloed and distorted version of the truth. This is a product of the information age, which gives us a diversity of thought and opinion. Don't mistake this as criticism, as it is a pearl of humanity to have such diversity, but it does create a fog. And in that fog breeds mistrust, something we have to live with and can't reason out of. This is yet another attempt to reason out of that fog (for me personally), knowing full well it may contribute to it.

The owner of this repo has a background in software engineering. Which in practice deals daily with applied logic with tangible outcomes with a diverse set of individuals. So applying the techniques within this practice to the above problem looks like a fun thing to do.


## Aim

The author wants to know how the kinematics of the universe operate. Ever since he was a child it has been a source of frustration that we have distorted view which has culminated in a General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics butting heads.

**The primary aim** is to gather hypotheses that have a tangible physical outcome, IE inline with experimental data and can agree with each other.

So this his way of trying to solve this puzzle. But he wants to leverage the diversity of thought we possess, hence why this is on Github. He invite anyone to contribute using the tools of this site.

**The secondary aim** is to label any contribution clearly so we know where it sits in the overall picture and can give the reader a brief overview of the status of the contribution. As the author has found the typical flags of what is deemed to have standing somewhat fail, and has wasted time in reading guff presented as fact too many times. If you are like the author, **take no heed in any contribution labelled as a draft, unless you like reading fiction.**
