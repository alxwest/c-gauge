# [draft] Electron

## Requisite Reading

## Abstract
- 4+1 nodes
- Total intrinsic energy is (c^2)+c 
- Spin is the fluctuation in the electron's wave hence it's mass is 1/2 of (c^2)+c as it wave will only create a mass function (and magnetic momentum) for just over 1/2 the wave.
- This magnetic moment will be



## Introduction


## Kinematics


## Tests
- It'll take (c^2)+c to create an electron.
- You should be able to direct the spin of electrons with interference.
