# [Draft] c-Gauge

## Abstract


## Introduction

This hypothesis assumes all quanta in physics can be determined by using the speed of light c. And then the kinematics of this quanta can be placed on a gauge with multiples of c as the scale.

This will hopefully lead to some insight as to why c is.


## Energy Equivalence

Energy is the area if taking c as the edge, so every physical interaction will involve energy and have a energy equivalence. This hypothesis assumes without energy it does not exist. There is no such thing as Newton's empty vacuum which is independent to it's contents. In fact everything is dependent of everything else. This is a hypothesis of relations, as the subject is determined by it's environment and vise versa. 

## c

So what is c? Why does it define our world? We know it's the speed at which light travels. We know it's the same in every reference frame. We know the amount of energy needed to travel from point A to point B is the same as the (|B-A|/c)*(mc^2) thus occupies that space between A and B, making the relative distance essentially 1 node.

I don't know but I feel it is in essence the root of locality and of spacetime.

## Examples

E=mc2 is first
spatial-energy equivalence is another
