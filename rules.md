# [draft] Rules

## Document format

Below is an outline of the ideal format for a contribution. This may change taking into account the type of contribution but that will be dealt with during the review process.

- Status
  - draft:
        Complete and utter toss, don't take heed on any ideas in draft as they are speculation at best, and dreams of a warped mind at worst.
  - ready:
        Completed template and is inline with the requisite reading. Reding is encouraged but is subject to change. Has 1 or more proposed tests
  - progress:
        Is being worked on and not ready for review.
  - review:
        Needs or is in active review.
  - proposed:
        Has at least 1 completed review that's pass review
  - proven:
        Has got at least 10 completed tests that agree with the hypothesis
- Requisite reading: List and link the required reading needed to understand the concepts presented in the contribution. It should be assumed the reader has a basic education but no background in further education. There should be no barrier to entry, IE link to a paywall, temporal status or status of standing.
- Sections
  - Abstract: 300 words or less briefly outlining the contribution
  - Introduction: Please outline how the contribution is structured with any intuition needed to access the kinematics.
  - Kinematics: The mathematical logic that underlies how the tests have or will arrive at their results.
  - Tests: The tests will be arranged under the completed or proposed header. 
  Each test will contain:
      - Arrange: Describe the situation needed to perform the test with variables that are to be tested in their initial state.
      - Act: The event that is enacted to provide a change in the situation.
      - Asset: What variables have changed and by what amount. 
- Citations: Please include a bibliography at the end of the contribution and use wiki style links when including citations in the body of the text.
