## Abstract

The c-gauge hypothesis is successful in deriving the limits of physical constants that were primarily the result of experimentation. This document contains a list of constants and their current status in c-gauge. 

It's success is only with constants that are derived from ratios that utilise SI units. Other types of constants cannot be derived from c-gauge, for example Colomb's constant, as it's a translation between 2 types of unit (Kelvin and m/s/g).
