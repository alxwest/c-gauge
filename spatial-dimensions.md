# [draft] Spatial dimension-energy equivalence

## Requisite Reading

## Abstract


## Introduction

The spatial dimensions that we are familiar with form from increasing
energy levels (\(\Sigma \bullet_{1}\)) in a function. To be more precise, the
probability that nodes will form an edge that can be observed as a
spatial dimension increases discreetly and proportionally with the sum
of nodes in that function.

## Kinematics

The relation between spatial dimensions and their probability is shown
by the following recursive formula:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:19}
  d_{x}\  = \ \left( \frac{d_{x - 1}}{x} \right)^{x}
\end{equation}

For each traditional spatial dimension \(x\) (1, 2, 3, etc) the product
of its probability \(d_{x}\) and the sum of function's nodes
\(\Sigma \bullet_{1}\) need to be 1 or above to signify it's possible:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:20}
  d_{x}\Sigma \bullet_{1}\  \geq 1\ 
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{1+1 dimension function}\label{dimension-function}

The probability for a 1+1 dimension (1D) function can be taken as 1:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:21}
  d_{1} = \ 1
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{2+1 dimensions}\label{dimensions}

The probability for a function to behave beyond 1+1 dimension depends on
the sum of nodes in the function. The probability that a function will
exhibit behaviour in 2+1 dimensions (the 2D function) is the following:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:22}
  d_{2}\  = \ .25\  = \ \frac{1}{4}
\end{equation}

So at its native scale a test for the 2D function can effectively be:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:23}
  d_{2}\Sigma \bullet\  \geq 1\
\end{equation}

Thus any function with 4 nodes (\(4\bullet\)) there is a hyperedge that
demonstrates a 2+1 dimension relation (Figure~\ref*{fig:2D}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includesvg{fig13}
  \caption{2D hyperedge}
  \label{fig:2D}
\end{figure}

As the 1D edges of the system each have a probability of 1, this means
the 2D hyperedge also has a probability of 1.

Interestingly the 2D function in (Figure~\ref*{fig:2D}) intuitively looks to support 2 2D
dimensions. Though if this was the case they would be interpreted
simultaneously as 2 1D systems, thus the system would be too ambiguous
to clearly denote 2D behaviour.

\subsubsection{3+1 dimensions}\label{dimensions-1}

Using the formula for 3+1 dimensions:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:24}
  d_{3}\  = \ 5.787\underline{037} \times 10^{- 4}\  = \ \frac{1}{1728}
\end{equation}

The test for a 3D function is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:25}
  d_{3}\Sigma \bullet_{1}\  \geq 1\ 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{4+1 dimensions}\label{dimensions-2}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:26}
  d_{4}\  = \ 4.3811193275... \times 10^{- 16}\  = \ \frac{1}{2282521714753540}
\end{equation}

For the purposes of this paper we are only concerned with systems that
pass the following:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:27}
  d_{4}\Sigma \bullet\  < \ 1\ 
\end{equation}

4D functions and beyond are out of the scope of this paper.
