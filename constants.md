# [draft] Constants

## Requisite Reading

## Abstract

The c-gauge hypothesis is successful in deriving the limits of physical constants that were primarily the result of experimentation. This document contains a list of constants and their current status in c-gauge. 

It's success is only with constants that are derived from ratios that utilise SI units. Other types of constants cannot be derived from c-gauge, for example Colomb's constant, as it's a translation between 2 types of unit (Kelvin and m/s/g).

## Introduction

## Table of Constants

| Constant | Symbol | Observed | Calculated | Hypothesis
|--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| Speed of light | c | 299792458 | - | [c](./c)
| Gravitation constant | G | 6.6743E-11 | 6.7501720033E-11 | [Gravitational Constant](./gravitational-constant)
| Elementary charge | e | 1.6021766300E-19 | 1.6023186291E-19 | [Elementary Charge](./elementary-charge)
| Planck constant | h | 6.6260701500E-34 | 6.4821012530E-34 | [Planck Constant](./planck-constant)
| Electric permittivity | Îµ0 | 8.8541878128E-12 | 8.6765227075E-12 | [Electric permittivity](./electric-permittivity)
| Electron mass | - | 5.1100000000E-01 | 5.0000000167E-01 | [Electron mass](./electron#mass)
| Proton mass | - | 938.3 | 938 | [Proton mass](./proton#mass)

None of the above derived constants are complete as they don't take into account the wave function. They are based on averages but once we have the wave function for each interaction they should get closer to what is observed. 

The other is the units we use don't exactly align. The definition of a second to too imprecise for the observed measurements to match with the calculated. 

For example the calculated electron mass would be exactly 0.5 if we took it's complete wave cycle to be 1 tick. Though even that would be too imprecise for the minimal function.

So the author would propose using an electron's wave function as the basis for local time.
